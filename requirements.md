# Enterprise Test Automation Framework Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for building an enterprise-grade test automation framework for Salesforce (AUT). The framework must support the following:

## Functional Requirements

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Structure code for maintainability and reusability.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Parameterize tests using external data sources.
- **Logging:** Provide detailed logs for test execution and analysis.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Automatically retry failed tests to handle intermittent issues.
- **Self-Healing:** Adapt to dynamic changes in the Salesforce UI to reduce maintenance.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Support execution on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other major browsers.
- **Multiple Environments:** Enable testing in sandbox, developer, and production environments.
- **Password Encryption:** Securely manage and use encrypted credentials.
- **Code Quality:** Enforce coding standards and integrate static analysis tools.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated execution.
- **Reusable Utilities:** Provide modular utilities for common test operations.
- **Data Generation:** Support dynamic test data creation for diverse scenarios.
- **Parallel Testing:** Enable concurrent test execution for faster feedback.
- **API Mocking/Testing:** Mock and validate Salesforce API interactions.

## Sample Test Scenarios

- Create and use a POM class for the login page.
- Perform data-driven record creation and validation.
- Validate logging during complex transactions.
- Test retry logic for failed logins.
- Demonstrate self-healing for changed page structures.
- Execute tests across multiple browsers and environments.
- Use encrypted passwords for login.
- Enforce code quality through reviews and analysis tools.
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated test runs.
- Implement and reuse utility functions.
- Generate and use dynamic test data.
- Run tests in parallel for optimized execution.
- Mock and test Salesforce API calls.

## Notes

- Customize scenarios for your Salesforce application and framework specifics.
- Update documentation as features and scenarios evolve.
